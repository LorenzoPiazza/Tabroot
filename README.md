## HI! We're Team Tabroot and this is an AI software capable of playing to the Tablut board game.

# Project structure

The project is structured in package as follows:

it.unibo.ai.didattica.competition.tablut.client:
This package contains some basic player as the HumanPlayer or the Random Player.

**it.unibo.ai.didattica.competition.tablut.client.tabrootplayer:
This package contains our player partecipating to the competition.

**it.unibo.ai.didattica.competition.tablut.client.search:
This package contains the strategy used for the Black and White Player and the implementation of the search Algorithm.

**it.unibo.ai.didattica.competition.tablut.optimization:
This package contains some optimizations to our current algorithm (e.g with the Transposition Table technique) but actually we haven't finished yet (it has some unresolved problem) and so they aren't used for the competition. However we're going to finish it in the near future.

it.unibo.ai.didattica.competition.tablut.server:
This package contains the server to whom connect with the client players to play.
